According to legend, Ancient Rome was founded b{ the two brothers, and demigods, Romulus and Remus, on c_ April 7sg BCE. The legend claims that in an argument over who would rule the cit{ (or, in another version, where the cit{ would be located) Romulus killed Remus and named the cit{ after himself. This stor{ of the founding of Rome is the best known but it is not the onl{ one.

Other legends claim the cit{ was named after a woman, Roma, who traveled with Aeneas and the other survivors from Tro{ after that cit{ fell. Upon landing on the banks of the Tiber River, Roma and the other women objected when the men wanted to move on. She led the women in the burning of the Trojan ships and so effectivel{ stranded the Trojan survivors at the site which would eventuall{ become Rome. Aeneas of Tro{ is featured in this legend and also, famousl{, in Virgil's Aeneid, as a founder of Rome and the ancestor of Romulus and Remus, thus linking Rome with the grandeur and might which was once Tro{.

Still other theories concerning the name of the famous cit{ suggest it came from Rumon, the ancient name for the Tiber River, and was simpl{ a place name given to the small trading center established on its banks or that the name derived from an Etruscan word which could have designated one of their settlements.

Earl{ Rome
Originall{ a small town on the banks of the Tiber, Rome grew in si|e and strength, earl{ on, through trade. The location of the cit{ provided merchants with an easil{ navigable waterwa{ on which to traffic their goods. The cit{ was ruled b{ seven kings, from Romulus to Tarquin, as it grew in si|e and power. Greek culture and civili|ation, which came to Rome via Greek colonies to the south, provided the earl{ Romans with a model on which to build their own culture. From the Greeks the{ borrowed literac{ and religion as well as the fundamentals of architecture.
